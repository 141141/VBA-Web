RestRequest
-----------
Create a rich definition of the request, including Resource (URL), Method (GET, POST, etc), Format (json), Headers, Querystring, Body, and more

Example:
```vbnet
Dim Request As New RestRequest

Request.Resource = "records/{record_id}"
Request.Method = httpPOST
Request.Format = json

Request.AddUrlSegment "record_id", 4
Request.AddParameter "last_updated", Now
Request.AddQuerystringParam "key", "API Key"

Request.AddHeader "Authorization", "Bearer (Token)"
Request.AddCookie "Cookie", "Value"

Dim Record As New Dictionary
Record.Add "name", "Bob"
Request.AddBody Record
```

RestClient
----------
Execute RestRequests, both sync and async, and use authentication

Examples:
```vbnet
Dim Client As New RestClient
Client.BaseUrl = "https://www.website.com/api"

Dim Request As New RestRequest
' ... setup Request

Dim Response As RestResponse
Set Response = Client.Execute(Request)

' Perform simple GET or POST directly with helpers
Set Response = Client.GetJSON("route/...")
' -> GET https://www.website.com/api/route/...

Dim Body As New Dictionary
' ... setup Body
Set Response = Client.PostJSON("route/...", Body)
' -> POST https://www.website.com/api/route/...
```

RestResponse
------------
Formatted response from RestRequest, including status (200, 404, etc), content, and parsed results

Example:
```vbnet
Set Response = Client.Execute(Request)

Response.StatusCode ' = 200
Response.StatusDescription ' = "OK"
Response.Content ' = {"a":1,"b":2,"c":3}
Response.Data("a") ' = 1
Response.Data("b") ' = 2
Response.Data("c") ' = 3
```
